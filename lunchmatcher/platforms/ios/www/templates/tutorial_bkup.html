        On this main screen you can set your availability and time range for the next lunch period (can be set at any time from 2pm on the day before, upto 90 min before the start of your lunch slot). You also set the radius around your location where you are willing to go for lunch. The app will find and store your current location, but you can change it on any day using the search box.<a href="http://www.lunchmatcher.com/cms/tutorials" class="tutorial-lnk">read more&raquo;</a>

        On this screen you can select venues (cafes/restaurants) from the list by either clicking on them once (to choose for the day only), or add them as a favorite (to keep them chosen every day). Matches will be made based on time and venue commonality with other users.<a href="http://www.lunchmatcher.com/cms/tutorials" class="tutorial-lnk">read more&raquo;</a>

        If matches are found, you will start receiving them every 15 minutes. You will see the other person’s photos, name, job title and company name as per LinkedIn, and you’ll need to decide whether to accept the match or not within the time limit. Keep in mind that rejecting or missing a match costs points!.<a href="http://www.lunchmatcher.com/cms/tutorials" class="tutorial-lnk">read more&raquo;</a>

        After both parties accept, you’ll get a confirmation screen showing the exact venue and time slot for your lunch meeting, as well as address and contact info. Simply proceed to attend the lunch, and afterwards you’ll get a chance to rate your experience with both the person you met and the venue.<a href="http://www.lunchmatcher.com/cms/tutorials" class="tutorial-lnk">read more&raquo;</a>

        This app is gamified with a fun points system, and you can check your balance and history at any time on this screen. You can also top off your points as needed to keep having more matches. Sharing on social media earns you free points each time so be sure to do it!.<a href="http://www.lunchmatcher.com/cms/tutorials" class="tutorial-lnk">read more&raquo;</a>
